## Spring Boot Learning Project - Employee Records 
Welcome to my Spring Boot learning project! This project is aimed at understanding the structure of a Spring Boot application, including the organization of models, services, controllers, and repositories. Through this project, I have learned about the flow of data in a Spring Boot application and how different components interact with each other.

Project Overview
In this project, I have developed a simple employee records management system using Spring Boot. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. Below is an overview of the key components of the project:

Models: Contains the entity classes that represent the data model of the application. In this project, the Employee class defines the structure of an employee record.

Services: Contains the service layer of the application, which encapsulates the business logic. The EmployeeService class provides methods to perform operations on employee records.

Controllers: Contains the RESTful API endpoints that handle HTTP requests and responses. The EmployeeController class maps incoming requests to appropriate methods in the service layer.

Repositories: Contains interfaces that extend Spring Data JPA's JpaRepository. These interfaces define methods for CRUD operations on the database. The EmployeeRepository interface provides methods to interact with the Employee entity.

### Project Structure
```
The project structure follows the standard layout recommended for Spring Boot applications:

Getting Started
To run the Spring Boot application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

Build the Project: Open the project in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and build the project using Maven or Gradle.

Configure Database: Configure the database connection settings in the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory.

Run the Application: Run the main application class (e.g., DemoApplication.java) to start the Spring Boot application.

Test the Endpoints: Use a tool like Postman to test the RESTful API endpoints defined in the EmployeeController class.
